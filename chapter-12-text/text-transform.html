    <h1>Briards</h1>

    <p class="intro">The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>.
        or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder
        and guardian of sheep...</p>
    <h2>Breed History</h2>
    <p>The breed characteristics of the Briard are of a medium-sized, rugged, agile dog, having a harsh coat and double
        dewclaws mounted low on each rear leg, resembling additional toes. Each double dew claw should have bone
        substance and nail, giving the appearance of a wider rear foot. Bred for centuries to herd, the additional
        digits on each rear foot give the Briard the ability to pivot on one foot for quick turns and complete
        turn-arounds, which are necessary when herding and guarding their flocks.</p>
