    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1tbs butter</li>
        <li>2tbs cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</li>
        <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
        <li>using a spatula fold the eggs from the 
            edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds 
            (as if you are making an omellete)
        </li>
        <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from
