    <h1>The Story in the book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
        an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies,of <i>Nature</i>,<i>New Scientis</i>,
        and all the other scientific journals he work had apperead in, was a well thumbed of <cite>On
            the Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer
        she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
        sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge
            of people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although many considered
        her pioneering work, unraiveling the secrets of the lamma
        <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievment,
        Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
